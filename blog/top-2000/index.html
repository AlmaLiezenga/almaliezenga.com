				<p>Ever since I met my current partner the Top 2000 has been an integral part of my holiday season. 
				The Top 2000 is an annual Dutch music marathon based on the 2000 â€˜best songs ever madeâ€™ (according 
				to middle-aged Dutch people). The Top started in 2000 with the turn of the century and runs 24 hours 
				a day from Christmas Eve till New Yearâ€™s. The number 1 (the best song EVER) is usually Queenâ€™s 
				Bohemian Rhapsody, which is, therefore, the song that ushers in the new year in most Dutch living rooms. </p>

				<p>At first I didnâ€™t care much for listening to 50%+ songs I didnâ€™t know nor liked, with a painfully high 
				level of 70s and 80s rock and very little hip hop (or songs from after 2000 for that matter, my desperate 
				attempt to vote Kanye West, BeyoncÃ©, and Ariana Grande into the list failed miserably with only 6 out of 
				my 35 selections actually making the cut). But Iâ€™m starting to understand the fun of not having to choose 
				what to listen to for a week, being annoyed at the old-fashioned choices that do make the cut and increasingly 
				recognizable songs as the week progresses.</p>
				
				<h3>Enter: data visualisation</h3>

				<p>So in the few days between Christmas and New Yearâ€™s I decided to practice my data visualization skills. 
				I wanted to try out plotlyâ€™s interactive plots and I was also eager to dip my toes into some web scraping. 
				So, here we are: some not so coherent visualizations of the Top 2000, not necessarily to support any 
				coherent conclusion (though it did confirm my presumed bias towards 70â€™s and 80â€™s rock) but just because 
				itâ€™s fun. All code and data can be found on GitHub.</p>
				
				<p>I would highly recommend viewing the visualisations on a laptop or tablet instead of a smartphone. </p>
				
				<h3>Counting Genres & Supergenres</h3>
				<p>With the Excel sheet of the Top 2000 that NPO Radio 2 provides it was easy enough to create a small 
				interactive visualization of the songs, artists, and release years. But I thought one more dimension would 
				add a lot of value: the musical genre. To get the genre of each song I used [Last.fm](http://Last.fm). I 
				wrote a pretty small loop and a few functions which were able to create a hyperlink for each artist that 
				would lead to their page on this website, which lists the genres of their music! With some usage of the 
				BeautifulSoup package I was able to extract this data from the HTML of the page. By simply counting the 
				number of songs in each of these genres I was able to create a fun plot, shown below (also visible at: ) 
				Note that songs are counted double (or triple, quadruple, or quintuple) as they are mostly tagged as 
				more than one genre. </p>

				<p>These genres were quite specific in some cases, which is fun to look through but maybe not very descriptive. 
				Therefore, I generalized the genres to several supergenres, combining a few lists by Multimediaeval and adding 
				additional genres were necessary (for example â€˜nederhopâ€™, â€˜nederpopâ€™, and â€˜gabberâ€™). To this end I only used 
				the first genre of each song (or the second genre if the first one didnâ€™t have a supergenre). This resulted in 
				the graph shown below (also visible at: ). </p>

				<h3>Visualising all songs</h3>

				<p>When I started out I had already created one plot which I liked the look of: a scatterplot with all songs 
				as dots. But it needed some more content. With the supergenres I had the third variable I was looking for. 
				Try out this nice plot (also visible at: )</p>
				
				<p>What I donâ€™t love is that the supergenres are not as generalized as I would like for this type of plot. 
				I therefore created the â€˜supersupergenresâ€™ which generalized over the supergenres once more to give a slightly 
				more intuitive sense of the data. I must admit though that my musical knowledge is limited so please donâ€™t 
				shame me for the poor combinations of genres. </p>

				<p>A few shortcomings are of course that a genre per song instead of per artist might have been more descriptive 
				but I couldnâ€™t find a suitable website for that purpose. I also would have liked to base the supergenre on all 4 
				or 5 genres instead of only the first one, but this got very complicated very fast. Some artists were also not 
				listed on last.fm, which I partly manually fixed but Iâ€™m sure the information on Dutch artists is slightly more 
				limited. The list of subgenres vs supergenres is also quite limited but I tried to really get most out. </p>
				
				<p>I hope you enjoy these plots and can find your own song picks in them (and agree with their genre!). Happy New Year!</p>
