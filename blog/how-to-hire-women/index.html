					<li>Setting pink backgrounds for every page slightly related to women in your business. </li>
					<li>Organizing 'Women in IT' events that include not a single technical workshop. </li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p> Tried all of the above but still no women will respond to your vacancy?! 
				Let me explain to you which simple factors actually draw in female applicants and 
				why companies that (only) care about these points soon end up on my 'pile of nopes'. </p>
					
				<p> As a soon-to-be graduate in the engineering/IT field I have been browsing through 
				vacancies quite regularly. In this process I've noticed that some job openings simply 
				draw me in more than others: some make me feel underqualified and insecure, while others
				make me feel ambitious and included. It's important to realise that creating a diverse and
				inclusive workplace starts with actually getting a diverse pool of applicants for your open 
				positions. Therefore, I took a dive into my 'pile of nopes' to figure out why those companies 
				don't attract me as a woman and what research has to say about a diverse recruiting process. 
				Here are a few factors that might impact the diversity of your pool of candidates (and how you
				can do better). </p>
			
				<h3>1. Be careful with what you wish for.</h3>
			
				<p> In the book <it>Lean In</it> Sheryl Sandberg quotes that: 'Men apply for a job when they meet only 
				60% of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100% of them'. Though this is a 
				speculative comment, I often recognise its essence in my conversations with fellow students and
				recent graduates. A Gender Insights Report analysing LinkedIn data also concluded that women are 
				16% less likely to apply to a job after viewing a vacancy, especially if the role is more senior
				than their current one. However, women are also more likely to actually get hired. Perhaps this 
				does showcase the behaviour illustrated by the quote: women only apply to jobs that they are very 
				qualified for.</p>

				<p> A few months ago I would stop reading a vacancy when the first 'requirement' that I didn't meet 
				popped up. Once I discovered that most of my male friends got their current jobs by going for these 
				stretch roles and that many employers actually assume you won't meet every requirement I decided to 
				be less picky and go for, let's say, 60%. Though this in itself is a useful tip for other job-seeking 
				women, I would hope that hiring companies also want to work on their half of this equation. As a 
				hiring company or recruiter you might think adding more and more requirements will result in more 
				suitable candidates, but what you're actually doing is creating hoops that women are less likely to
				jump through. You can take this into consideration by clearly separating must-have's from nice-to-have's 
				or could-have's. You can also explicitly state that candidates do not need to fit every requirement to 
				be considered for the position (if this is actually the case).</p>
			
				<h3>2. Reconsider your traditional demands.</h3>
				
				<p> The first requirement listed in many vacancies is a bachelor's or master's degree. Though women have 
				recently caught up to men in terms of master degrees earned overall, men in Europe still earn close to 
				3 times as many engineering and information technologies degrees as women (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Tertiary_education_statistics#Participation_of_men_and_women_in_tertiary_education">Eurostat, 2018</a>). Ask yourself 
				if what you are looking for is a piece of paper or a specific skillset. Do you want someone with a strong 
				analytic mindset and advanced skills in Python and machine learning? Write that down instead of the master 
				in Artificial Intelligence you had originally stated! By stating such a 'traditional' requirement you might 
				be missing out on a lot of amazing people with a less traditional background, like those who have previously 
				worked in other sectors.</p>
				
				<p> Another traditional demand that might cause a less diverse set of applicants is asking for a referral. 
				The same LinkedIn report stated that women are 26% less likely to ask for a referral. We can also imagine 
				that people with a large gap in their career (for example because they were taking care of a sick relative 
				or children) might be reluctant to ask employers from years ago for a referral. Be aware of the fact that 
				women carry out at least 2.5 times more unpaid household and care work than men (<a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_457317.pdf">International Labour 
				Organization, 2016</a>) and therefore are much more likely to have such gaps in their careers. Instead of stating 
				a referral as a demand in your initial application you can also bring up the subject of past employers in a 
				first interview.</p>
			
				<h3>3. State your goals and commitments.</h3>
			
				<p> Though it might seem obvious to you that you do not discriminate in your recruiting process, it doesn't 
				harm stating this explicitly in your vacancy. In my experience, I have felt very encouraged because of statements 
				of commitment to a fair and non-discriminatory recruiting process as well as equal pay. One example that I have 
				seen many times in slightly adjusted forms is: '[Company name] *is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants 
				will be considered without attention to race, colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, 
				or disability status.'* However, make sure to actually commit to these promises if you make them in your vacancy. 
				Additionally, if you do have a diversity and inclusion statement or policy (and you should), make sure potential 
				employees are able to find it on your website! Be honest about the challenges you are facing in your road to 
				diversity but make sure that potential candidates are not left in the dark about them. Try to be aware of the fact 
				that just because you have never experienced discrimination in a hiring process, doesn't mean others have the same 
				experience, or that they don't fear being discriminated against. </p>
			
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				
				<p> Countless times I have come across companies on career fairs or recruiting events complaining about how they 
				cannot find any women to work for them. Often times, those same companies make mistakes in the points mentioned 
				above and gloss over it with pink banners. It makes me wonder if they really want to be a diverse company or just 
				want to hire women to hit their quota and continue business as usual. I am by no means expecting companies to lower 
				their bar to be inclusive. What I do hope for is that companies that say they are committed to diversity also 
				understand that that means embracing different career paths, ways of working and thinking. At the end of the day, 
				a diverse team is the best team.</p>
			
				<p> <i> A disclaimer: these might be some useful tips to create a more diverse pool of applicants but don't forget 
				to actually practice what you preach in your recruiting process and thereafter. Take care of your parental leave, 
				ensure equal pay and create a safe working environment for minorities. Also, do not forget to be inclusive to other 
				groups of minorities, such as people of colour and the disabled.</i> </p>
