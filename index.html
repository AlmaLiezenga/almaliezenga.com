					<h2>About me</h2>
					<p>I like working with data and tech to help people solve
					problems. Although I am comfortable with the "harder"
					aspects of data engineering and data science, I firmly
					believe that tech shouldn't be self-serving. What I like
					doing best is connecting with people, sharing knowledge, and
					discovering how data can help improve life and work.
					</p>

					<p>Friends and colleagues describe me as ambitious,
					decisive, and result-oriented. The question I like to ask
					most is "Why?" and the answer I would rather not hear is
					"Because we have always done it this way."</p>

					<p>I have a business informatics background and experience
					in data analytics and engineering. Most recently, I worked
					as a developer advocate at <a
					href="https://iterative.ai/">Iterative</a>, where I got to
					learn a lot about MLOps. I really liked that my work there
					heavily involved community outreach and facilitating
					learning experiences: speaking at conferences, hosting
					workshops, writing technical guides, and helping construct
					an online course.</p>

					<h2>Projects</h2>
					<p>Outside of work I love trekking through nature and

					organising stuff. Perhaps you might know me from one of the
