				<p>Ever since I met my current partner the Top 2000 has been an integral part of my holiday season. 
				The Top 2000 is an annual Dutch music marathon based on the 2000 ‚Äòbest songs ever made‚Äô (according 
				to middle-aged Dutch people). The Top started in 2000 with the turn of the century and runs 24 hours 
				a day from Christmas Eve till New Year‚Äôs. The number 1 (the best song EVER) is usually Queen‚Äôs 
				Bohemian Rhapsody, which is, therefore, the song that ushers in the new year in most Dutch living rooms. </p>

				<p>At first I didn‚Äôt care much for listening to 50%+ songs I didn‚Äôt know nor liked, with a painfully high 
				level of 70s and 80s rock and very little hiphop (or songs from after 2000 for that matter, my desperate 
				attempt to vote Kanye West, Beyonc√© and Ariana Grande into the list failed miserably with only 6 out of 
				my 35 selections actually making the cut). But I‚Äôm starting to understand the fun of not having to choose 
				what to listen to for a week, being annoyed at the old fashioned choices that do make the cut and increasingly 
				recognizable songs as the week progresses.</p>
				
				<h3>Enter: data visualisation</h3>

				<p>So in the few days between Christmas and New Year‚Äôs I decided to practice my data visualisation skills. 
				I wanted to try out plotly‚Äôs interactive plots and I was also eager to dip my toes into some web scraping. 
				So, here we are: some not very coherent visualisations of the Top 2000, not necessarily to support any 
				coherent conclusion (though it did confirm my presumed bias towards 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs rock) but just because 
				it‚Äôs fun. All code and data can be found on Github.</p>
				
				<p>I would highly recommend viewing the visualisations on a laptop or tablet instead of a smartphone. </p>
				
				<h3>Counting Genres & Supergenres</h3>
				<p>With the excel sheet of the Top 2000 that NPO Radio 2 provides it was easy enough to create a small 
				interactieve visualisation of the songs, artists and release years. But I thought one more dimension would 
				add a lot of value: the musical genre. To get the genre of each song I used [Last.fm](http://Last.fm). I 
				wrote a pretty small loop and a few functions which were able to create a hyperlink for each artist that 
				would lead to their page on this website, which lists the genres of their music! With some usage of the 
				BeautifulSoup package I was able to extract this data from the html of the page. By simply counting the 
				number of songs in each of these genres I was able to create a fun plot, shown below (also visible at: ) 
				Note that songs are counted double (or triple, or quadruple, or quintuple) as they are mostly tagged as 
				more than one genre. </p>

				<p>These genres were quite specific in some cases, which is fun to look through but maybe not very descriptive. 
				Therefore, I generalized the genres to several supergenres, combining a few lists by Multimediaeval and adding 
				additional genres were necessary (for example for ‚Äònederhop‚Äô, ‚Äònederpop‚Äô and ‚Äògabber‚Äô). To this end I only used 
				the first genre of each song (or the second genre if the first one didn‚Äôt have a supergenre). This resulted in 
				the graph shown below (also visible at: ). </p>
				
				<h3>Visualising all songs</h3>

				<p>When I started out I had already created one plot which I liked the look of: a scatterplot with all songs 
				as dots. But it needed some more content. With the supergenres I had the third variable I was looking for. 
				Try out this nice plot (also visible at: )</p>
				
				<p>What I don‚Äôt love is that the supergenres are not as generalized as I would like for this type of plot. 
				I therefore created the ‚Äòsupersupergenres‚Äô which generalized over the supergenres once more to give a slightly 
				more intuitive sense of the data. I must admit though that my musical knowledge is limited so please don‚Äôt 
				shame me for the poor combinations of genres. </p>

				<p>A few shortcomings are of course that a genre per song instead of per artist might have been more descriptive 
				but I couldn‚Äôt find a suitable website for that purpose. I also would have liked to base the supergenre on all 4 
				or 5 genres instead of only the first one, but this got very complicated very fast. Some artists were also not 
				listed on last.fm, which I partly manually fixed but I‚Äôm sure the information on Dutch artists is slightly more 
				limited. The list of subgenres vs supergenres is also quite limited but I tried to really get most out. </p>
				
				<p>I hope you enjoy these plots and can find your own song picks in them (and agree with their genre!). Happy New Year!</p>
